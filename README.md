# TaskTracker

Task Tracker is a "to-do-list" web app that I created using Python's Django framework. The web application allows users to create an account,
so they can keep track of their tasks or errands they may have for the day.

When you open the main site, you are greeted with the login page for Task Tracker directing users to enter their email and password.

If you do not have an account, you can follow the "register" link below to create an account.

Once directed to the registration page, the user is then prompted to enter their first name, email and password while confirming their password.
If the email is in use, an error message will appear, as well as if it is not a valid email or if the passwords do not match. Once the user as entered their information, 
they are then brought to the homepage of the site where you can view your created tasks.

At the top of the homepage, is a site navigation bar that has a logout button and the title "Task Tracker" works as a button to bring you back to the homepage.
Below the navigation bar, is a greeting with the user's first name and two buttons. One for creating a new task and the other for filtering the current tasks.

To create a new task, the user is directed to another page where they are prompted to enter the task's title, priority and any additional details.

Once the task is created, you are directed back to the main page of the site where you can view your new task along with your other current tasks. The new task is automatically added to the bottom of the list.

To make any changes to the task, such as changing the title, priority or adding more details, click the title of the task and you will be brought to another page to edit the task.
